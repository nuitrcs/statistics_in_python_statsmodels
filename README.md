Python Workshop Series: statmodels for regression analysis
You will learn how to build regression models and evaluate the model’s performance using statmodels, which is a Python package that provides classes and functions for statistical testing, modeling, and exploration.

Prerequisites: Participants should be familiar with Python at the level of the Python Fundamentals Bootcamp, another introductory Python workshop, or be a self-taught Python coder. Additionally, participants should be familiar with the concepts in regression analysis as the workshop only covers performing the analysis in Python.
